# twig_mods_templates
twig templates for MODS metadata

We're using this with the islandora_multi_importer module from mnylc https://github.com/mnylc/islandora_multi_importer

More on twig here: https://twig.symfony.com/

these templates will make use of the Jasny twig-extensions PCRE filters https://github.com/jasny/twig-extensions

when using data to test out these templates, use comma separated files .csv and make sure to use UTF-8 character 
encoding.

For example in excel, you should use the Data->Get External Data->From Text to import csv in UTF-8 encoding 
with commas as delimiters.
